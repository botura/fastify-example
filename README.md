# fastify - fastify-cli - swagger - sequelize - postgres - jwt - fluent json schema - standardjs

### TL;DR;
Is not always easy to learn new things from scratch. 

This project is an attempt to summarize several concepts IÂ´ve learned about these tools and perhaps helps someone in the beggining path.

It has some CRUD examples wich envolves several concepts.

## Database:

Even I'm using sequelize I'll not create database schema using the sequelize migrate tool (code first aproach). I personnaly think it is not a very realistic situation where someone starts a project with no legacy database. At some point changes will occur in backend framework, but database will remain the same. That's just my opinion about this subject.

Database schema: it has a three tables with some fields and relations:
